        <li><span>All bonuses have a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount of your bonus unless specified otherwise in the specific promotion. Wagering requirements refer to the amount of money you stake during the betting process, relative to the amount of your bonus - otherwise known as the amount you’ve ‘turned over’. Therefore, the requirements specified above mean that, you have to stake 38 times the amount of your bonus before you can withdraw the funds. If you were to make a deposit of €100 you would receive €100 of bonus money. You will then be required to place bets to the value of at least €100 x 38 = €3800 before you can withdraw the bonus winnings from your account. Whether you win or lose on your bets has no effect on the status of your bonus. Some games contribute less than their full wager to the wagering requirement, see the following list: Slots 100%, all other games 10%. A bet will count towards the progression as soon as it has been settled.</span></li>
