        <li><span>This promotion is open to Swedish residents only, who are 18 years old or older.</span></li>
        <li><span>This promotion is only available once per player and is active from 2014-05-23 14:00 to 2014-05-25 18:59 CET.</span></li>
        <li><span>Players are limited to one account per player. If BlingCity detects the use of multiple accounts by a player we reserve the right to close down the additional accounts. Any bonuses on the additional accounts will be removed.</span></li>
        <li><span>To get the free €25, a player has to create a valid account on blingcity.com. €25 will then be added to that account as bonus money.</span></li>
        <li><span>All bonuses have a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount of your bonus unless specified otherwise in the specific promotion. Wagering requirements refer to the amount of money you stake during the betting process, relative to the amount of your bonus - otherwise known as the amount you’ve ‘turned over’. Therefore, the requirements specified above mean that, you have to stake 38 times the amount of your bonus before you can withdraw the funds. In this case you would be required to place bets to the value €25 x 38 = €950 before the bonus is redeemed. Whether you win or lose on your bets has no effect on the status of your bonus. Some games contribute less than their full wager to the wagering requirement, see the following list: Slots 100%, all other games 10%. A bet will count towards the progression as soon as it has been settled.</span></li>
        <li><span>Risk-free wagering on any games will not contribute to the wagering requirement.</span></li>
        <li><span>Any bonus wagering requirements must be met within 30 days of qualifying for the bonus or the bonus balance will be removed.</span></li>
        <li><span>Only bonus money can be used to meet the wagering requirements, real money deposited will not count against the wagering requirement. You’ll wager your deposit money before you wager your bonus money.</span></li>
        <li><span>If a customer requests a withdrawal before meeting the wagering requirements, all bonuses and winnings will be removed from the account.</span></li>
        <li><span>The maximum amount of real money that a player can win with the free €25 bonus money, after the wagering requirements are met, is €50.</span></li>
        <li><span>In order to withdraw any money won while playing with the €25 bonus money, players will have to provide identification to BlingCity for verification. This is due to Maltese Lotteries and Gaming Authority KYC requirements.</span></li>
        <li><span>If the terms of a promotion are breached or if there is evidence of wagers which due to the conditions of promotions, result in guaranteed customer profits, BlingCity reserves the right to reclaim the bonuses of those promotions. BlingCity also reserves the right to levy an administrative fee on the player up to the value of the bonus value of the promotion in order to cover administrative costs.</span></li>
        <li><span>BlingCity reserves the right to cancel this promotion or amend its terms at any moment.</span></li>
        <li><span>All BlingCity promotions are intended for recreational players and BlingCity may at its sole discretion limit the eligibility of customers to participate in all or part of any promotion and or remove the promotion or its winnings from player accounts.</span></li>
