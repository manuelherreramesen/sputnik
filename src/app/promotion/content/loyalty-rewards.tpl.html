<div class="terms-and-conditions">
    <ol>
        <li><span>All players on blingcity.com are part of the Loyalty Rewards program as soon as they sign up for an account on blingcity.com. Doing so is deemed to constitute your full acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.</span></li>
        <li><span>As part of the Loyalty Reward program your account will go up in level. Levels are acquired by wagering money on the games on blingcity.com, the more money you have played for, the higher the level of your account.</span></li>
        <li><span>When your Loyalty Program reward level increases you will receive different rewards tied to your level. These are Items, Deposit Bonus Level, Cashback Mondays and Blings.</span></li>
        <li>
            <span>Items are virtual accessories tied to your citizen. Items also have a variable bonus tied to them, these vary with the Item and are useable once. The bonus tied to an acquired Item is detailed in the My Gallery section on blingcity.com. Once the bonus is used you keep the Item but it is moved to My Collection and can no longer be used for bonus purposes. Possible bonuses for an Item are free spins, one-time deposit bonuses and free bonus money.</span>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Free spins acquired from Items are a certain amount of free spins for a specific game. Winnings from free spins are subject to a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount won.</span></li>
                <li><span>Deposit bonuses acquired from Items are useable one time. Deposit bonuses don't stack, only the highest one applies. The amount is expressed as a percentage and a maximum bonus amount. The percentage is relative to the deposited money, i.e. a 150% deposit bonus on a deposit of €100 would give you €150 of bonus money. The bonus money can't exceed the maximum bonus amount. Bonus money is subject to a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount.</span></li>
                <li><span>Free bonus money acquired from items are subject to a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount.</span></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span>The Deposit Bonus Level that is tied to your level is a permanent deposit bonus. It's expressed as a percentage. It's available for all deposits made by the player from the time it is acquired onwards and is selected or deselected on the Deposit page. The maximum bonus amount for these deposits is €1200. Deposit bonuses don't stack, only the highest one applies. All bonus money acquired with the deposit bonus is subject to a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount.</span></li>
        <li>
            <span>All bonuses have a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount of your bonus unless specified otherwise. Wagering requirements refer to the amount of money you stake during the betting process, relative to the amount of your bonus - otherwise known as the amount you've ‘turned over'. Therefore, the requirements specified above mean that, you have to stake 38 times the amount of your bonus before you can withdraw the funds. If you were to make a deposit of €50 and got a bonus worth 200% of your deposit, you would receive €100 of bonus money. You will then be required to place bets to the value of at least €100 x 38 = €3800 before you can withdraw the bonus winnings from your account. Whether you win or lose on your bets has no effect on the status of your bonus. Some games contribute less than their full wager to the wagering requirement, see the following list: Video slots and Slots 100%, all other games 10%. A bet will count towards the progression as soon as it has been settled.</span>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Risk-free wagering on any games will not contribute to the wagering requirement.</span></li>
                <li><span>nly bonus money can be used to meet the wagering requirements, real money deposited will not count against the wagering requirement. You'll wager your deposit money before you wager your bonus money.</span></li>
                <li><span>If a customer requests a withdrawal before meeting the wagering requirements, all bonuses and winnings will be removed from the account.</span></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span>Cashback Mondays is expressed as a percentage and is the amount you get back of your previous weeks wagers of real money. The money you receive is real money, not bonus money. A week is defined as the time period from Monday 0:00 CET to Sunday 23:59 CET. The money is deposited into the players account around noon on Monday.</span></li>
        <li><span>Blings are BlingCity's own currency. You receive a random amount every time you level up. You get more Blings at higher levels than at lower levels. Blings can be used for different things. You can convert them to real money or bonus money.
