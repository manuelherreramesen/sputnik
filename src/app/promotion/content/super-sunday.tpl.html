        <li><span>If you have used the Super Sunday Bonus at least four times during the duration of the promotion and at noon on Sunday the 15th of 2014 and your account balance is €1 or less, you will receive additional free spins, calculated by your lowest single deposit during the duration of the promotion. This is cumulative with the free spins received through clause 7.</span></li>
        <li><span>The free spins will be awarded within seven days of the end of the promotion.</span></li>
        <li><span>No free spins will be awarded if any withdrawal is made by the player during the duration of this promotion.</span></li>
        <li><span>All bonuses have a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount of your bonus unless specified otherwise in the specific promotion. Wagering requirements refer to the amount of money you stake during the betting process, relative to the amount of your bonus - otherwise known as the amount you’ve ‘turned over’. Therefore, the requirements specified above mean that, you have to stake 38 times the amount of your bonus before you can withdraw the funds. If you were to make a deposit of €100 you would receive €50 of bonus money. You will then be required to place bets to the value of at least €50 x 38 = €1900 before you can withdraw the bonus winnings from your account. Whether you win or lose on your bets has no effect on the status of your bonus. Some games contribute less than their full wager to the wagering requirement, see the following list: Slots 100%, all other games 10%. A bet will count towards the progression as soon as it has been settled.</span></li>
        <li><span>All winnings made from free spins are considered bonus money and are subject to a wagering requirement of 38 times the amount won.</span></li>
        <li><span>Risk-free wagering on any games will not contribute to the wagering requirement.</span></li>
        <li><span>Any bonus wagering requirements must be met within 30 days of qualifying for the bonus or the bonus balance will be removed.</span></li>
        <li><span>Only bonus money can be used to meet the wagering requirements, real money deposited will not count against the wagering requirement. You’ll wager your deposit money before you wager your bonus money.</span></li>
        <li><span>If a customer requests a withdrawal before meeting the wagering requirements, all bonuses and winnings will be removed from the account.</span></li>
        <li><span>The maximum withdrawal amount from the Super Sunday Bonus promotion money is €1000, using the bonus money of this promotion.</span></li>
        <li><span>If the terms of a promotion are breached or if there is evidence of wagers which due to the conditions of promotions, result in guaranteed customer profits, BlingCity reserves the right to reclaim the bonuses of those promotions. BlingCity also reserves the right to levy an administrative fee on the player up to the value of the bonus value of the promotion in order to cover administrative costs.</span></li>
        <li><span>BlingCity reserves the right to cancel this promotion or amend its terms at any moment.</span></li>
